# DATA-198-SP21

Data 198: Applied Data Science for Research and Discovery

Data 198 is a generic course listing that encompasses several [Data 8](https://data8.org) related courses.

In Spring 2021 this version was run as a DECAL course - the instructors were part of DSUS and the OLS team working on Data 8x. The vision was for a project based class that would take a student from Data 8 to Pandas to working on a new dataset.
